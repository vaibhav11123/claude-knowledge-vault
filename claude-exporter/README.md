   - Export individual conversations
   - Export all filtered conversations as ZIP
   
#### Bulk Export
1. In the browse page, select your format and filters
2. Click "Export All"

python scripts/claude_to_obsidian.py --zip <downloaded.zip> --out obsidian-vault
```

### Export Formats

#### JSON
- Complete data including all branches and metadata
- Best for data preservation and programmatic use
- Includes all message versions and conversation branches

#### Markdown
- Human-readable format with formatting
- Shows only the current conversation branch
- Includes optional metadata (timestamps, model info)
- Great for documentation or sharing

#### Plain Text
- Simple format following Claude's prompt style
- Uses "User:" and "Claude:" prefixes
- Shows only the current conversation branch
- Ideal for copying into other LLMs or text editors

---
### Troubleshooting

#### "Organization ID not configured"
- Follow the setup steps in [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md#configuration)
- Make sure you're copying the complete UUID from the URL

#### "Not authenticated" error
- Make sure you're logged into Claude.ai
- Try refreshing the Claude.ai page

#### Export fails for some conversations
- Some very old conversations might have different data structures
- Check the browser console for specific error messages
- The ZIP export includes a summary file listing any failed exports

#### Content Security Policy errors
- Make sure you're using the latest version of the extension
- Try reloading the extension from chrome://extensions/

**For browser-specific troubleshooting issues**, see [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md#Troubleshooting)

### Known Limitations

- Rate limiting: The extension processes conversations in small batches to avoid overwhelming the API
- Using a VPN may return a 403 error when trying to connect to the Claude API
- Plaintext and markdown formats only export the currently selected branch in conversations with multiple branches
- Large bulk exports may take several minutes
- Some special content types (like artifacts) may not export perfectly
- API does not preserve per-message model data
  - `conversation.model` from the API is the *current* model only — when chats get bounced (deprecation, guardrails kicking to Sonnet 4, etc.) the original model is lost

---
### Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All data processing happens in your browser
- **No External Servers**: The extension doesn't send data anywhere
- **Your Authentication**: Uses your existing Claude.ai session
- **Open Source**: You can review all code before installation
